# Movie-Recommender-System

The birth of the Motion Picture Camera in the late 18th century gave birth to possibly the most potent form of entertainment in existence: Cinema. Movies have managed to enthrall audiences ever since one second clips of racing horses emerged in the 1890s to the introduction of sound in the 1920s to the birth of color in the 1930s to mainstream 3D Movies in the early 2010s.

This Project on Movie Data Analysis and Recommendation Systems. In my first notebook, I attempted at performing an extensive exploratory data analysis on Movies Metadata collected from TMDB and built two extremely minimalist predictive models to predict movie revenue and movie success and visualise which features influence the revenue and success respectively

The second task is to implement a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. 

Below is the list of features available-
* adult: Indicates if the movie is X-Rated or Adult.
